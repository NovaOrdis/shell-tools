# Next

* Add setw/cdw to shell-tools.
* Make shell-tools the keeper of common library functions in form of std.shlib. Integrate with novaordis-release-tools. Now https://github.com/NovaOrdis/novaordis-release-tools/blob/master/src/main/bash/run is the keeper of common library functions.
* Figure a way to use the same std.shlib in em.
* Make installing on a new machine (Mac, linux, cygwin) easy. Document.
